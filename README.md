## End of year project : "Rushomy"
# Hello there. I am happy to announce my new project. A search engine called Rushomy(LOL). I will start uploading soon. Not very soon, but many a mickle makes a muckle. If I have to talk about this open source project in a small way, we will use the data of many known search engines for ourselves. BUT! Not for normal search; just for dorking operations. You can customize some search criteria by clicking the "add" button. In this way, we offer an osint interface that will not require you to know the dorking keywords of other search engines. See you soon. ^^
